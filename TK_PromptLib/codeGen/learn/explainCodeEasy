I don't know how to code, but I want to understand how this works. 
Explain the following code to me in a way that a non-technical person can understand. 
Label major sections with numbers and funny names with nmenonics and codenames to make the easier to remember.
Each section should be explained in a different character and tone, aim for humor and encourage me to keep going
Start with an overview and then a step by step breakdown going line by line.
